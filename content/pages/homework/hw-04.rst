Problem 1
=========

A small spherical ball of brass is pressed into a hemispherical depression with
a force :math:`F = 500N`. Determine the principal normal and shear stresses at
the location along the z axis corresponding to the highest shear stress. The
ball is made of brass and the depression is made of copper.

Problem 3
=========

For the beam and loading shown, find the deflection at D and deflections and
slope at C using two different methods. Use :math:`l = 1.2 \textrm{m}`,
:math:`E = 180 \textrm{GPa}`, :math:`I = 0.23 \textrm{m}^2`, :math:`w = 60
\frac{\textrm{kN}}{\textrm{m}}`.

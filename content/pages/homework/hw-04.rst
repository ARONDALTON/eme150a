Problem 1
=========

A small spherical ball of brass is pressed into a hemispherical depression with
a force :math:`F = 500N`. Determine the principal normal and shear stresses at
the location along the z axis corresponding to the highest shear stress. The
ball is made of brass and the depression is made of copper.

Problem 3
=========

For the beam and loading shown, find both the slope and deflection at points C
and D using two different methods. Additionally, describe the slope between
points C and D. Use :math:`l = 1.2 \textrm{m}`, :math:`E = 180 \textrm{GPa}`,
:math:`I = 0.23 \textrm{m}^2`, :math:`w = 60 \frac{\textrm{kN}}{\textrm{m}}`.

Problem 4
=========

Beverage cans are made from tin plated steel in some parts of the world instead
of an aluminum alloy. Design a can that is a typical can size using 1018
hot-rolled steel (Table A-20) such that it meets a specified design factor of 3
against yielding if the maximum pressure that can be developed in the can by
the undissolved CO2 is 350 KPa. How much thicker or thinner must the can walls
be compared to a typical aluminum alloy can?

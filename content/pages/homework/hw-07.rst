Problem 1
=========

(1) Estimate the endurance limit and the low cycle fatigue strength for an
axially loaded ground steel specimen with :math:`S_{ut} = 150 \mathrm{ksi}`,
:math:`d= 1.0 \mathrm{in}`, and :math:`T = 70^\circ \mathrm{F}`. (2) Determine
the expected life for :math:`\sigma_a = 75 \mathrm{ksi}`.

Problem 2
=========

Determine the required diameter for a round steel element that is axially
loaded from -2500 to 2500 lb in fully reversed cycles. Assume it is ground,
:math:`S_{ut} = 150 \mathrm{ksi}`, and is loaded at :math:`T = 70^\circ
\mathrm{F}`. Determine the diameter for infinite life and :math:`10^3` cycles.

Problem 3
=========

Given a 2024-T3 aluminum specimen forged to :math:`2.0 \mathrm{in}` round,
determine the fatigue strength for :math:`3 \times 10^7` cycles of loading for
fully reversed torsion. Note that for non-ferrous metals, the unmodified
fatigue strength is taken at :math:`N = 5 \times 10^8` cycles (see Table A-24).

Problem 4
=========

A simple hot rolled 1020 steel cantilever beam is loaded transversely at the
end with a fully reversing load of :math:`\pm 5 \mathrm{kN}`. The beam has a
rectangular cross section with a width of :math:`40 \mathrm{mm}`. What is the
required height of the beam's cross section to guarantee safe operation up to
:math:`N = 10^4 \mathrm{cycles}` with a design factor of 2? Neglect any stress
concentrations.

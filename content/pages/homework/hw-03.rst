Problem 1
=========

What is the maximum force :math:`F` that can be applied to this system to
ensure that the stress in member :math:`CD` never exceeds 20 kpsi and the point
:math:`A` moves no more than 0.05"? Assume that the curved bar, :math:`ABC`, is
much more rigid than :math:`CD`, i.e. assume it doesn't deform. The modulus of
elasticity of the bar :math:`CD` is :math:`6\times10^6
\frac{\mathrm{lb}}{\mathrm{in}^2}` and the cross sectional area is
:math:`0.25\mathrm{in}^2`. All of the joints are pin joints.

Problem 2
=========

Three strain gauges are arranged in the orientation shown below on a free
surface of a stressed member. The measured strains from the strain gauges are:

- :math:`\epsilon_A = 50\times10^{-6}`
- :math:`\epsilon_B = 120\times10^{-6}`
- :math:`\epsilon_C = 264\times10^{-6}`

a. Derive the symbolic expressions for :math:`\epsilon_x, \epsilon_y,
   \epsilon_z` for this configuration. Use only rational numbers, i.e. no
   decimal numbers and compute the state of strain.
b. Find the principal strains and directions.
c. If :math:`E=106\mathrm{GPa}` and :math:`G=40\mathrm{GPa}`, what are the
   principal stresses and directions? Keep in mind that the normal stress on
   the surface is 0 because it is a free surface.
d. What is the maximum principal shear stress?

Problem 3
=========

Find the maximum stress in the axially loaded member shown below. The hole is
far enough away from the step down that the stress concentrations do not
interact.

Problem 4
=========

A rock climbing carabiner is shown below. The carabiner must be able to
withstand a force up to 2700 lb to be safe enough to catch a 10 ft fall. What
are the curved beam theory predicted stresses at the inner and outer points on
section A-A? The cross section is circular.

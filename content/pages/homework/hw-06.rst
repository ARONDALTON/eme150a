Problem 1
=========

Given the same problem from homework #2 where the rod radius is 0.75 in,
determine the whether the rod will fail at point A under the given loading if
the material is cold drawn 1018 carbon steel. If the rod will not fail report
the factor of safety. Show results for both the maximum shear stress theory and
the distortion energy theory.

Problem 2
=========

A pressure vessel is made of an aluminum alloy tubing with suitable end
closures. This cylinder has a 3.5" in OD and a 0.1875" wall thickness. The
material has a tensile yield strength of 46 kpsi and a compressive yield
strength of 60 kpsi. Using the Coulomb-Mohr Theory, determine the factor of
safety if the pressure-release valve is set at 2500 psi.

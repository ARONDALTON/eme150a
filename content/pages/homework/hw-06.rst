Problem 1
=========

Given the same problem from homework #2 where the rod diameter is 0.75 in,
determine the whether the rod will fail at point A under the given loading if
the material is cold drawn 1018 carbon steel. If the rod will not fail report
the factor of safety. Show results for both the maximum shear stress theory and
the distortion energy theory.

Problem 2
=========

Determine the safety factors at points A and B for the bracket shown below.  It
is made of ASTM Class 50 Cast Iron (Table A-24). The variables have the
following values: l = 6in, a = 8 in, d = 1.5 in, F = 1000 lb. Use the modified
Mohr Theory.

Problem 2
=========

The solid rod shown in the figure is subject to the two loads at point B. The
rod has a radius of 0.75 in. Determine the state of stress at point A, sketch
the stress cube, and write out the stress tensor with respect to the provided
coordinate system.

Problem 3
=========

The normal stresses on threee sides of a triangular element are as indicated.
Find the shear stresses, the principal stresses, and the principal directions.

Problem 4
=========

The figure below shows the state of plane stress at a point. Draw the state of
stress if the element is rotated counterclockwise :math:`40^\circ` relative to
the given position. Use Mohr's circle to do the rotation and show the diagram.

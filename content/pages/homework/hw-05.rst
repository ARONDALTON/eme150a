Problem 1
=========

Find the deflection of the end of the bar in the direction of the applied force
using Castigliano's theorem. The bar is made from steel.

Problem 2
=========

Shown below is a 3/16" diameter steel wire where R=5" and l=3". The applied
force, P, is 1 lb. Estimate the vertical deflection of point A and justify any
components of strain energy that you neglect.

Problem 3
=========

A piston and connecting rod are shown below. If the operating pressure in the
chamber is 2000 psi, the rod ends are pin joints, and the rod is made of AISI
1030 steel what should the preferred diameter of the rod be for a design factor
of 3 to prevent buckling if the rod is 30 inches long.

Problem 4
=========

Determine an expression for what the outside diameter of a slender tube must be
for buckling to occur if the inside diameter is d, the outside diameter is D,
and the ratio of the two is K=d/D. The expression should be in terms of K, the
critical load, column length, modulus of elasticity, and the end condition
constant.

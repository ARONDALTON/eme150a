Problem 1
=========

A steel tensile link with a circular cross section with no stress
concentrations is subjected to a fluctuating load (1000 to 5000 lbs). Use
:math:`S_{ut}=150\mathrm{kpsi}`, :math:`S_y=120\mathrm{kpsi}`. Assume a highly
polished specimen and design factor of 2. Find the diameter for infinite life
and for :math:`10^3` cycles.

Problem 2
=========

The element shown below is subjected to a fluctuating load that ranges between
4 kip in tension and 14 kip in compression. The dimensions are :math:`r=0.313
\mathrm{in}`, :math:`d=0.5\mathrm{in}`, :math:`h=0.375\mathrm{in}`,
:math:`w=4\mathrm{in}`. Determine the factor of safety if the material is cold
drawn AISI 1018 steel.

Problem 3
=========

The AISI hot rolled 1020 steel element shown is welded to the fixed plate with
a 0.125" fillet weld. This fillet introduces stress concentration factors of
:math:`K_{t}=1.8` and :math:`K_{ts}=1.6`. The dimensions are
:math:`d=0.875\mathrm{in}`, :math:`l_1=4\mathrm{in}`, :math:`l_2=3\mathrm{in}`.
The load F cycles from 50 lbs to 100 lbs. Using the Goodman criteria for
fluctuating stress, find the factor of safety at point A with respect to
infinite life or the number of cycles to failure for finite life.

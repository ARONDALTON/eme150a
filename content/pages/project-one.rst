:title: Project One: Reverse Engineering
:status: hidden

Introduction
============

The first project for the course will introduce you to the initial stages of
`reverse engineering`_. It is important for an engineer to develop the ability
to observe existing products/systems and determine how they function and why
they were designed they way they were. Most, if not all, new ideas are
generated after observing and experiencing existing engineering solutions [1]_.

The learning objectives for the student are to develop the ability to:

- identify engineered products and systems
- explain both verbally and written how an existing product or system functions
- identify materials and manufacturing processes
- identify engineering design reasoning and decisions
- peer review presentations and reports

Instructions
============

The first task is to maintain a notebook of designs that you observe in your
everyday life over the first two weeks of the quarter. You should purchase a
notebook with blank line-less pages so that you can take notes and generate
sketches of the products and systems you observe. Carry the notebook with you
at all times, observe as many designs as possible in any domain (i.e.,
mechanical, architectural, electrical, interior, fashion, pop-culture, etc.)
using an engineer's "eye", and keep a log in the notebook concerning your
observations. Of all the designs you observe, you'll ultimately need to detail
two favorite designs in your notebook and finalize one of those in a formal
written report. Both of which will be peer reviewed by your teammates and then
graded by the instructors. Your design notebook must be submitted with the
final written report.

Possible Observable Objects
===========================

Any human-made item that you encounter can qualify, here are some examples:

- household products and machines, e.g. washing machines, kitchen appliances,
  lamps, electrical boxes
- buildings and architecture
- vehicles: trains, planes, automobiles, bicycles, etc
- garments and textiles
- city infrastructure: traffic, sewage, etc
- toys
- electronic devices

Don't let this list limit you, there are endless possibilities.

Timeline
========

Friday September 25
   The project will be introduced in class during the discussion section with a
   kickoff group activity to get everyone started.
Friday October 2
   Each student will bring their notebook to class with at least 50 different
   designs that have been observed and noted. **Number your designs.** The
   instructors will take a grade for your notebook in class.
Friday October 9
   Continue to collect designs, but during the previous week you should choose
   5 designs that are you favorite and flesh out the details of the designs in
   your notebook with more notes, calculations, sketches, etc. During class you
   will present your top two designs to your group in a "lighting talk", i.e. 2
   minutes per design with 2 minutes group feedback per design. We will check
   for the five detailed designs in class. **Number your designs.**
Friday October 16
   During the previous week you should choose your top design to detail in your
   report. First drafts will be due at the beginning of class. To "turn in" the
   draft you need to share it via Google drive with both instructors and your
   group members. The draft must be shared before the beginning of class on
   Friday. We will give an introduction to peer review process during class.
Wednesday October 21
   Each team member should peer review each other team member's report before
   class. Each team member must provide at least two positive and two negative
   comments on each teammates' paper and any additional comments must come in
   positive/negative pairs. Make sure to use the insert comment functionality
   and/or the "suggestions" editing mode so that the author of the paper can
   choose whether to accept your advice or not. See the shared Google Doc for
   more tips.
Friday October 23
   After you've turned in your draft you should work to refine your report
   based off of you peer's feedback. The final report is due by beginning of
   class this day.

Design Notebook
===============

To execute this project you should purchase and use a design notebook. A
bookstore or an art supply store will have several types of bound books of 8.5
x 11 inch blank white paper. It is best not to have lines or grids because they
constrain your thinking so get blank pages. [2]_

In your notebook, you will make notes and sketches that help you document and
design changes for a particular system. Consider the notebook as your own
personal space, in which you work and think. Use any combination of words and
pictures to help you flesh out ideas. Try to use a mix of quantity and quality,
sometimes go for sheer numbers of ideas and other times try to draw a nice
sketch or do a calculation. If you do work on computer or take photographs
paste these into you notebook. Try to carry your notebook with you all the
time, you never know when an idea or thought will reveal itself.

Be sure to use any relevant engineering knowledge you have gained in previous
courses and this course to enhance your design understanding.

.. [2] You may use an electronic notebook (e.g. tablet) if you can easily
   include sketches and share the resulting documents to be graded by your
   instructors. The final output to be turned in with the report should be a
   PDF.

Things to address
=================

In your notebook and final report you likely want to address questions such as
these. **You are not required to cover all of these questions nor should these
limit you.**

- What does it look like (use sketches and/or photographs)?
- How big is it? (You could use formal dimensioning or scale relative to some
  familiar object.)
- What is the working principle?
- What power sources are used by the device?
- Where are the moving parts and how do they operate? Sketches of the device in
  multiple configurations can help.
- What materials are used for the various parts?
- What functions do any notches or changes in cross-section fulfill?
- How does the device interface with the user?
- What human need does the device fulfill?
- What is the expected design lifetime of this product (time or number of
  cycles)?
- What happens when the item no longer functions? Can the item be recycled,
  reused?
- How reliable is the product? What are the consequences of failure?
- How is the device used?
- What is expected of the device by the user?
- What sorts of loads are put on the device?
- In what ways would you expect the device to fail?
- Where are the highest stresses?
- What types of analysis might be used to analyze various parts of the device?
- Why are different materials used for various parts of the design?
- How is the device assembled?
- How are the parts manufactured?

Report
======

The goal of the report is to explain the design you studied by giving the
reader an idea of how it functions and why it was designed the way it was.

The main content items we are looking for are:

- That the explanation should be communicated through written and graphical
  means.
- You should identify the "need" that the design was meant to address.
- You should comment on whether the need is or isn't addressed well, in your
  engineering opinion and explain why you think so.
- What are the design's weaknesses and strengths, and why?
- That you address one or more of the "things to address" above. If you choose
  one it should be thoroughly detailed and less so if you choose more.
- You can close with suggestions for improvements to the design if you have
  any.

You will be graded on:

- Accuracy and correctness of your design explanation
- Utilization of engineering principles in the explanation
- Clarity of your ideas
- Depth of investigation into the design
- Use of effective textual and graphical communication
- Formatting (minor)

The report for this project must be created using Google Docs. It must include
these pages:

Title Page
----------

This page should include title, author, student id, date, and course number and
an abstract. The abstract should be a very short summary of the project. One
paragraph should be plenty.

Content Pages (three pages)
---------------------------

- Introduction: Introduce the design and what you are you want us to learn
  about it.
- Detailed explanations and descriptions: Text, figures, tables, equations, etc
  that explain the design and address some, more or all of the issues listed
  above.
- Conclusion: Summary of what you learned and maybe things you'd still like to
  learn about the design.

We strongly encourage you to use visual communication liberally in the report.
Reports should contain a significant amount of visual information such as
sketches, drawings, word maps, etc.

Reference Page
--------------

Cite sources for any information that you didn't generate yourself.

Appendix
--------

You may include an optional appendix with extra details, but you will only be
graded on the above pages. The appendix could include more details of a
calculation or a more detailed drawing/sketch.

Formatting
----------

- The Google Doc file name should follow this format:
  ``EME150A-PROJ01-LASTNAME-FIRSTNAME``, for example:
  ``EME150A-PROJ01-MOORE-JASON``.
- 11 pt Arial font (default)
- Default margins
- Equations and variables must be created with "Insert > Equation" or "Insert >
  Special Characters".
- Figures should have captions. See this `blog post
  <https://chromebookandroidnews.wordpress.com/2014/09/08/how-to-caption-and-wrap-text-around-images-or-tables-in-google-docs/>`_
  for a method of adding captions with Google Docs.
- Use whatever citation style you prefer.

Peer Review
===========

You will be responsible for peer reviewing you teammates' work. Each team
member will draft their report using Google Docs. Once the draft is complete
you will need to share the document with your teammates and the two
instructors.  You are then responsible for reading and critiquing your team
members' reports with the goal of helping them improve the work. You must
provide two positive and two negative pieces of feedback via the "Insert >
Comment" or "Suggesting" feature in Google Docs. This feedback cannot be the
same as other teammates. Do not edit their paper directly! This allows the
author to decided which comments they want to include or dismiss. If you want
to add more feedback it must come in pairs: positive and negative.

Things to think about:

- Is the writing clear? Do you understand what your teammate is trying to
  describe and express?
- Are the images/graphics/sketches clear and explanatory?
- Is the document succinct and to the point?
- Are the sentences coherent, well-constructed, varied?
- What could be added (or subtracted) to give you a better picture and
  understanding of the design?

Tips:

- Stay away from overly general comments, be specific. For example, "I just
  didn't get it!" is not useful but "This sentence is unclear, if you do X and
  Y it may become clearer." is.
- Keep it impersonal and be polite. Statements like "this is a stupid idea"
  will not be tolerated and cause your project grade to be lowered.

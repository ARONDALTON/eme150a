*Why do you have so many websites for the course; can't we simply have one?*
   Unfortunately, there is no single web site or application that does
   everything we need for the course. A mixture of my course website, Canvas,
   and Piazza provide the necessary functionally. I have a separate website so
   that other instructors can easily reuse my public materials. Plus, I enjoy
   making my own websites. Canvas is needed to privately share information with
   you, like your grades. And Piazza offers a very nice interface for class Q &
   A.
*Can I use a programmable calculator for the exams?*
   No, I do not allow anything but a simple scientific calculator. Spend $10
   and get one for the exams.
*Will we have to memorize equations for exams?*
   You will have to know the basic equations from the course. Elaborate
   equations will be provided. An equation sheet may also be allowed for exams.

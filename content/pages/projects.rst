`Project Part One: Reverse Engineering <{filename}/pages/project-one.rst>`_
   The first project will introduce you to thinking critically about mechanical
   design of existing products. The final report will be due a week before the
   midterm.
`Project Part Two: Design of a Unitrans Bicycle Rack <{filename}/pages/project-two.rst>`_
   During the second project you will collectively work on an open ended design
   of a bicycle rack that holds at least two bicycles on the front of a
   Unitrans bus. You will have to create the physical design and ensure that it
   is safe from static and dynamic failure and along with being easy and
   inexpensive to produce and manufacture.

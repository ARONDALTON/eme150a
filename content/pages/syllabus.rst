Time and Location
=================

The lecture/discussion meets on Mondays and Wednesdays from 9:00-9:50 AM and
Fridays 9:00-10:50 AM in 1132 Bainer.

Office Hours
============

Office hours are to be determined.

Academic Integrity
==================

Academic dishonesty will not be tolerated. Please visit the Academic Integrity
web page from UC Davis Office of Student Judicial Affairs at
http://sja.ucdavis.edu/academic-integrity.html to review the campus' policy on
academic responsibility and integrity and read the UC Davis code of academic
conduct (http://sja.ucdavis.edu/cac.html).

The midterm and final exam will be closed note, closed book and done on an
individual basis.

Feel free to discuss homework assignments and work on them together, but each
student must turn in a *unique* solution. Keep in mind that actually doing all
of the homework yourself is critical for learning and passing the exams.

Both projects will group efforts but also include individual evaluation along
with peer evaluations.

Textbook
========

*Shigley's Mechanical Engineering Design*, Budynas and Nisbett, 10th Edition,
McGraw Hill Education. ISBN 978-0-07-339820-4 [`Book Information`_]

.. _Book Information: http://highered.mheducation.com/sites/0073398209/information_center_view0/index.html

Both reading and homework will be assigned from the textbook. A copy of the
textbook will be available on two-hour reserve at the library. I will do my
best to provide the homework in a way that doesn't require you purchase the
book to read the problems. Older editions will be more than sufficient for
reading and studying. Keep in mind that this particular textbook is likely one
of the better references to have for your career as a mechanical engineer.

   There will be regular and irregular in class quizzes and assignments.
Lecture Homework
   Weekly homework will be assigned which will be due at the beginning of class
   the following week.
Design Projects
   There will be two design projects, one for the first half of the course and
   one for the second. Grades will be determined based on individual
   performance, group performance, and peer evaluations. To pass the course,
   each student must complete the two projects.

Smartsite
=========

We will make use of smartsite for the course. Log in to smartsite.ucdavis.edu
with you Kerberos ID and passphrase then select **EME 150A FQ 2015** or access
the smartsite through this link:

TODO : Add link.

We will be using several features in smartsite:

Announcements
   All class announcements will be sent to your UCD email address and be
   collected here. Check this regularly during the class for important
   information.
Assignments
   You will turn in some or all assignments through smartsite. If you have the
   ability to scan or take a clear photograph of your assignments, you can turn
   them in digitally. Otherwise they must be handed in at the beginning of
   class on the due date. Compress all of your files and documents into a
   single zip file with your name and section in the file name and attach it to
   the assignment. All documents must be in PDF form. Use Inventor's Pack and
   Go feature for inventor files.
Chat Room
   Feel free to use the chat room to meet with you peers and group members if
   you can't all be in one physical place. I will be available for chat during
   our scheduled office hours.
Course Website
   This displays this website within smartsite.
Email Archive
   All emails sent to the class will be archived here. You may send emails to
   TODO@smartsite.ucdavis.edu if you have general questions that all
   of the class may benefit from. **Do not abuse this.** Send personal emails
   to me and the TA's through our UCD email addresses.
Forums
   Feel free to start topics and discussion in the forums. All class
   participants and the instructors will be able to comment.
Gradebook
   Your grades and basic stats on your relative performance will be available
   as the course goes along.
Mailtool
   This allows you to send emails to everyone or just the instructors. The same
   rules apply as in the "Email Archive" section.
Resources
   Files, documents, and other resources will be available here for download.

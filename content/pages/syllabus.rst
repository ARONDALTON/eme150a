Course Description
==================

| University of California, Davis
| Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering
| Mechanical Design - EME 150A
| Fall 2015, Lecture: MWF 9-9:50AM, Discussion: F 10-10:50AM
| CRN: 51884
| `Catalog Entry <http://catalog.ucdavis.edu/programs/EME/EMEcourses.html#pgfId-3900785>`_

This course introduces the student to mechanical design theory and methodology
that build on the fundamentals learned in statics, dynamics, strength of
materials, computer aided drafting, and manufacturing. The course will prepare
the student to both individually and collaboratively design mechanical systems
that will be safe from failure and ensure that other design constraints are
met.

Objectives
----------

1. To develop your analytical skills and intuitive judgment in mechanical
   design and the evaluation of structural integrity.
2. To improve your skills in identifying and using appropriate resources in
   engineering design and failure analysis.
3. To expose you to open-ended design problems that require conceptual and
   analytical problem solving and documentation of a design solution.
4. To enhance your skills in engineering writing.

Prerequisites
-------------

- ENG 35 Statics
- ENG 45/45Y Properties of Materials
- ENG 104 Mechanics of Materials
- EME 50 Manufacturing Processes (may be taken concurrently)

ABET Educational Student Outcomes
---------------------------------

This course addresses the following Educational Outcomes for the Mechanical
Engineering and Aeronautical Science and Engineering Programs::

   a. an ability to apply knowledge of mathematics, science, and engineering
   c. an ability to design a system , component, or process to meet desired
      needs within realistic constraints such as economic, environmental,
      social, political, ethical, health and safety, manufacturability, and
      sustainability
   e. an ability to identify, formulate, and solve engineering problems
   f. an understanding of professional and ethical responsibility
   g. an ability to communicate effectively
   h. the broad education necessary to understand the impact of engineering
      solutions in a global, economic, environmental, and societal context
   k. an ability to use the techniques, skills, and modern engineering tools
      necessary for engineering practice.

Instructors
===========

| Jason K. Moore
| 2095 Bainer Hall
| jasonmoore@ucdavis.edu
|
| Matthew Lefort
| mplefort@ucdavis.edu

Time and Location
=================

The lecture/discussion meets on Mondays and Wednesdays from 9:00-9:50 AM and
Fridays 9:00-10:50 AM in 1132 Bainer.

**If you have any conflicts with the schedule, especially for the midterm or
exam, you must tell me in the first week of class (emergencies will be the only
exception).**

Office Hours
============

Jason will hold office hours on Wednesdays and Fridays from 2-3PM in Bainer
2095.

Matthew will hold office hours on Thursdays and Fridays from 11AM-12PM in the
Computer Aided Engineering Lab (2121A) Bainer Hall.

Academic Integrity
==================

Academic dishonesty will not be tolerated. Please visit the `Academic Integrity
web page <http://sja.ucdavis.edu/academic-integrity.html>`_ from UC Davis
Office of Student Judicial Affairs to review the campus' policy on academic
responsibility and integrity and read the UC Davis `code of academic conduct
<http://sja.ucdavis.edu/cac.html>`_.

The midterm and final exam will be closed note, closed book and done on an
individual basis.

Feel free to discuss homework assignments and work on them together, but each
student must turn in a *unique* solution. Keep in mind that actually doing all
of the homework yourself is critical for learning and passing the course.

The first project will be an individual project but have elements of
collaboration built in. The second project will be a group effort but also
include individual evaluation along with peer evaluations.

Textbook
========

*Shigley's Mechanical Engineering Design*, Budynas and Nisbett, 10th Edition,
McGraw Hill Education. ISBN 978-0-07-339820-4 [`Book Information`_]

.. _Book Information: http://highered.mheducation.com/sites/0073398209/information_center_view0/index.html

Both reading will be assigned from the textbook. A copy of the textbook will be
available on two-hour reserve at the library. I will do my best to provide the
homework in a way that doesn't require you purchase the book to read any
problems but this is not guaranteed. Older editions will be more than
sufficient for reading and studying. Keep in mind that this particular textbook
is one of the better references to have for your career if you work in
mechanical design.

Assignments & Grades
====================

Grades will be available in the smartsite.ucdavis.edu_ grade book periodically
throughout the course along with class statistics. Check the website on a
regular basis to gauge your performance. Keep in mind that **15% is deducted
per business day late** on all assignments. Take extra caution if you believe
your exams or assignments to be incorrectly graded. If the request for
additional points is found **NOT** to be valid, the points may be
**subtracted** from the total score of the assignment or exam.

================  ===
Homework          10%
In class          10%
Design Project 1  20%
Design Project 2  20%
Midterm           20%
Final             20%

Homework
   Weekly homework will be assigned which will be due before class the
   following week in the mechanical engineering homework **drop box D** in
   Bainer Hall.
In class
   There will be a variety of in class assignments and quizzes that may count
   towards your grade.
`Design Projects`_
   There will be two design projects, one for the first half of the course and
   one for the second. Grades will be determined based on individual
   performance, group performance, and peer evaluations. To pass the course,
   each student must complete the two projects.

Smartsite
=========

We will make use of smartsite for the course. Log in to smartsite.ucdavis.edu
with you Kerberos ID and passphrase then select **EME 150A FQ 2015** or access
the smartsite through this link:

https://smartsite.ucdavis.edu/portal/site/eme150a-1-fall-2015

We will be using several features in smartsite:

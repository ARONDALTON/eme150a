:status: hidden

Preparation
===========

- Read sections 3-2 and 3-3
- Read the wikipedia article on shear and moment diagrams:
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shear_and_moment_diagram
- Try Examples 3-2 and 3-3 and/or one of the Problems 3-5 to 3-8
- All 50 of your designs should be in your notebook and numbered for an in
  class grade.
- Be prepared to work on problems during the discussion session (time
  dependent). You will spend the time working on the homework while Matt and I
  help and do problems on the board.

Concepts
========

After this lesson you should be able to:

- Understand the relationship between external loads and the internal shear
  loads and bending moments.
- Draw the shear load and bending moment diagrams for a variety of beams.
- Utilize singularity functions to compute the shear loads and bending moments.

Upcoming Due Dates
==================

- Homework #1 will be due Monday, October 5
- Five in-notebook detailed designs will be due Friday, October 9th

- Questions?

- Feedback

  - How many drawings have you done?
  - Work on handwriting and removing the notes too quickly.

- Review of uncertainty

  - Gaussian distributions can model many real world observations
  - We can make predictions of quality, strenght, loads, etc in a stochastic
    manner.
  - Probabilities are the area under the Gaussian probaility density curve and
    are found by integration.
  - The book provides a table of probabilities for a nominal Gaussian curve.

Free Body Diagrams

- system: any isolated part or portion of a machine or structure
- used to isolate and identify both internal and external loads on a design
  element
- defines:

  - coordinate systems
  - known and unknown forces

:math:`\sum F = \frac{dp}{dt}` and :math:`\sum M = \frac{dH}{dt}`

Static Equilibrium (no velocity)

F = 0 and M = 0

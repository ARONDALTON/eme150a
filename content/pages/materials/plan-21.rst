- HW #6: will accept answers for radius or diameter of 0.75"
- HW #7 will be posted today.
- Memo 2 will be graded today.
- Memo 3: static failure will be due Friday

   - Identify the elements with the highest stresses due to static loadings.
   - Requirement: 250 lb standing on end of rack, but you need to locate other
     failure points in your design.
   - Show individual factor of safety for critical points
     (hand calcs required, FEA can be used to support your conclusions)
   - Report the overall factor of safety for the design.
   - Jusitfy your material and geometry choices.
   - Explanations on what you may need to redesign to make it safer: material
     choice, geometry changes, etc.

- Results from FEA due to smartsite by Friday

:title: Preparation for Friday, September 30, 2016
:status: hidden

Preparation
===========

- Read sections 3-2 and 3-3
- For more information, read the wikipedia articles on `shear and moment
  diagrams <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shear_and_moment_diagram>`_ and
  `singularity functions
  <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singularity_function>`_.
- Try Examples 3-2 and 3-3 and/or one of the Problems 3-5 to 3-8
- All 30 of your designs should be in your notebook and numbered for an in
  class grade.
- Bring your laptop with the Anaconda_ Python 3.5 distribution installed. We
  will go over using SymPy to solve mechanics problems.

Concepts
========

After this lesson you should be able to:

- Understand the relationship between external loads and the internal shear
  loads and bending moments.
- Draw the shear load and bending moment diagrams for a variety of beams.
- Utilize singularity functions to compute the shear loads and bending moments.

Upcoming Due Dates
==================

- Homework #1 is due Monday, October 3
- Four in-notebook detailed designs will be due Friday, October 7th

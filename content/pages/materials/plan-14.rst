Midterm:

- Closed book, no written materials allowed, no devices except a
  non-programmable calculator.
- I'll provide the paper. You bring writing implement.
- You will be expected to remember equations but not super long ones.
- All numerical math will be such that you can get an estimate without a
  calculator or answers that get all the way up to punching in the numbers will
  be accepted.

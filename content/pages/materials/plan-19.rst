- Memos are graded, see smartsite for comments.

Review
------

- Columns under compressive loads will most likely buckle before other types of
  failure.
- Buckling is a catastrophic failure mode, there are no warning signs and it
  happens suddenly.
- Careful attention for intermediate length columns is needed because theory
  doesn't predict buckling very well.
- The critical load is modified depending on the end conditions of the column.
- The fixed end conditions are quite conservative.

Goals
-----

- Define static failure and "theory".
- Explain the three types of ductile static failure theories.

- HW 5 solutions will be posted today.
- HW 6 will be posted today.
- The initial design memo is due Friday.

  - No more than three design ideas, ideally pick one main one to start with an
    iterate over.
  - Should have working sketches and drawings.
  - Explanation of how your design will meet core requirements and what other
    features your are adding.
  - Thoughts on material choices.
  - What will be the most likely weak spots and what analysis you will need to
    use.

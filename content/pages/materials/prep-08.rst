Preparation
===========

- Read sections 3-4, 3-5, 3-6, 3-7
- For more info see the Wikipedia pages on `Cauchy's Stress Tensor
  <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauchy_stress_tensor#Principal_stresses_and_stress_invariants>`_
  and `Mohr's Circle <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohr's_circle>`_.
- Make copies of two of your five designs to use during your `lightning talks
  <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_talk>`_.
- Have your notebook ready for grading in class, i.e. clearly label the 4
  designs and make it as easy as possible for us to find them. For example, you
  can use post-it notes to label them.
- Plan and practice your two lightning talks.

Concepts
========

After this lesson you should be able to:

- Compute the 3D principal stresses and directions.
- Utilize Mohr's circle (2D/3D) to find stresses at any orientation.

Upcoming Due Dates
==================

- Homework #2 is due Monday October 10th
- A rough draft of your Project 1 report will be due Friday, October 16th
  before class.

9:00
====

Review
------

- Stress on arbitrary plane (who did the example?)
- Principal stresses intro

Goals
-----

- Show the eigenvalue/vector problem for state of stress that finds the
  eigenvectors.
- Be able sketch Mohr's circle for 2D stress plane and identify important
  stresses.
- Practice communicating ideas and getting feedback

Questions?

9:05
====

Continue the principal stress eigenvalue/vector problem.

9:25
====

Mohr's circle reintroduction

9:40
====

Exercise

9:55
====

Break: get into groups before we start and turn in your notebook to the desk
Ask Matt to be the timer

10:00
=====

- Explain the lightning talk process
- Demo lightning talk and review with Jason and Matt
- The goal is to practice communicating engineering ideas to your colleauges
  and to get feedback on your designs so you can improve them and to get
  inspiration and ideas from your team mates

10:05
=====

Lightning talks: 2 minutes signals given to switch
for 40 minutes

member 1: talk, review
member 2: talk, review
member 3: talk, review
member 4: talk, review
member 1: talk, review
.
.
.

teams of 3 can discuss in the last part or listen in on other groups

10:45
=====

- Mark in class grade for participation
- Pick up your notebook
- Pick up homework on way out, solutions will be shared on Smartsite.
- Note that two assigments will be due next friday: report draft and solidworks
  turtorial and exercise
- Bring your laptop to class next friday with solidworks installed. If you
  don't have, it's fine because we will be working pairs.

Collect feedback: pos/neg/hrs spent

Review
------

- Stress tensor represents state of 3D stress at any given point.
- 9 values, 6 unique, symmetric matrix

Goals
-----

- Derive the expressions for the stress vector on an arbitrary oriented
  infinitesimal plane
- Be able to apply derived equations
- Principal stresses

Questions?

9:05
====

Review confusing things from last lecture:

- Complementary shear
- Shear from torsion
- Transverse shear in bending

Wrap up

Remind about next class Project 1 activity.

- Turn notebook in open to first of 5 designs clearly numbered (use a sticky
  note if they aren't one after another)
- Copy your two favorite designs for your team members to look at while you
  speak about them.
- Lightning talk: 2 minutes per 2 designs
- Goal is to explain your design in sentences with help from your diagrams,
  sketches, etc.
- No slides or anything, just you and the paper you give/show you teammates
- Make a list of what main points you want to make.
- Practice the talk so you say what you want to say in 2 minutes.
- After each talk, your team members will critique the design. If someone says
  a positive critique, next has to be a neg, and vice versa. Your goal is to help
  you teammate improve and strengthen their design explanation.

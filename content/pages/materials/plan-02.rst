:title: Plan for Friday, September 23, 2016
:status: hidden

TODO : We should brainstorm this together and improve it. Look up some reverse
engineering activities to get ideas.

Prep
====

- Make sure you know how to operate the TV screen in the Design Studio
- You can borrow the document camera from the MAE conference room (make sure to
  get it when a meeting isn't going on) to use when students show off designs.
  Make sure that this works with the TV beforehand.
- Create examples sketches for demonstrations.

Introduction to Project 1 9:00
==============================

- Tell them the learning objectives.
- Define reverse engineering and it's relevance to mechanical design.
- Tell them that the final goal is to design a bicycle rack for a Unitrans bus
  (project part 2)
- Using examples, give them an idea of how the different things that you would
  add to your notebook when investigating an object with an "engineer's" eye.
  They need a clear idea of  what constitues 1 item in the notebook.

Quiz on past materials 9:15
===========================

- Give quiz on Statics, Properties of Materials, Mechanics of Materials
- Go over solution.

Break 9:45
==========

Five minute rest.

Break into Teams 9:50
=====================

- Post teams on screen or board
- Each team should move to a individual table
- Give few minutes for introductions

Notebook Activity 9:20
======================

NOTE : If the students bring at least one laptop (or even just their phone) per
group they could start investigating bicycle rack designs and we could have
them focus on that instead of random objects in the room.

- Each person should select an item in that they can find in the room that has
  mechanical aspects.
- Make 5 items in the notebook that describe aspects of the design
- Take x minutes to share design with team
- Now trade items with a team member
- Make 5 items about the design
- Share 5 items
- Have people come up and share what they've done.

Wrap Up
=======

- Explain project assignment. 30 designs about bicycle racks in notebook due
  next Friday. Bring notebook to class. Number design explanations.
- Reading for prepartion on Monday.

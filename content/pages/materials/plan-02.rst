:title: Plan for Friday, September 23, 2016
:status: hidden

Prep
====

- Make sure you know how to operate the TV screen in the Design Studio
- You can borrow the document camera from the MAE conference room (make sure to
  get it when a meeting isn't going on) to use when students show off designs.
  Make sure that this works with the TV beforehand.
- Create examples sketches for demonstrations.

Review of past materials 9:00
=============================

Statics
-------

The key takeaway from statics is the ability to create and interpret free body
diagrams. We will focus on find the internal loads in mechanical elements so
that we can compute the stress and strain at any point on the element.
Understanding the loads and constraints applied to various structures is
critical for finding the internal loads and free body diagrams are the best way
to visualize and organize that information.

Discussion: Show them a mechanical structure and have them draw the free body
diagram.

Material Properties
-------------------

As a mechanical designer you will be responsible for choosing the best
materials for a given design. The materials will need to have the appropriate
strength, hardness, stiffness, corrosion resistance, weight, cost, and be
manufacturable.

Strength of Materials
---------------------

Finding the stress and strain at any given point in a mechanical element is
critical to design. The relationships between geometric and material properties
to stress and strain are the analytic key to designing mechanical elements that
do not break and deflect the desired amount.

Discussion: Have the students draw the stress-strain curve for steel and
identify as much information and properties as they can on it.

Introduction to Project 1 9:20
==============================

- Tell them the learning objectives.
- Define reverse engineering and it's relevance to mechanical design.
- Tell them that the final goal is to design a bicycle rack for a Unitrans bus
  (project part 2)
- Using an example stationary bicycle rack, give them an idea of how the
  different things that you would add to your notebook when investigating an
  object with an "engineer's" eye. They need a clear idea of  what constitues 1
  item in the notebook. Be sure to explain "design aspects" so they get an idea
  of the scope for a single item in the notebook.

Break into Teams 9:30
=====================

- Post teams on screen or board
- Each team should move to a individual table
- Give few minutes for introductions

Break 9:40
==========

Chill

Notebook Activity 9:50
======================

- Remind them about the final design project: front mounted bicycle rack for
  Unitrans.
- Goal: make 5 design aspects in the notebook that describe aspects of the
  bicycle rack designs they can think of or find online
- Take 10 minutes to draw by yourself.
- Walk around and help teams through all of this process.
- Take 10 minutes to share design with team, take turns
- Now, pick 5 ways to enhance 5 of your teammate's designs (10 minutes)
- Pick one design aspect to share with the whole class and draw on rolling
  whiteboard.
- Have a rep from each team come up come up and share what they've done.

Wrap Up 10:45 (or earlier)
==========================

- Explain project assignment. 30 designs about bicycle racks in notebook due
  next Friday. Bring notebook to class. Number design explanations.
- Reading for prepartion on Monday will be posted on the website.

Questions?

Review mechanical design

Review uncertainty
   Every number has an uncertainity associated with it and you must take this
   into account in design.
Review design factor and factory of saftey
   Design factors help account for uncertainity. The design factor is the
   desired value and the factor of the safety is the actual value.

====

Stochastic failure criteria and reliability

Goals
-----
- Understand that uncertainty is more realistically modeled by statisical
  models.
- Be able to compute Gaussian probablities using a transform table.

Dimensions, units, sig figs

Tolerances
----------

- Nominal sizes are note exact sizes
- Tolerance limits are specified as absolutes
- Tight tolerances = higher costs
- Dimensioning should include the minimum non-redudant info
- Dimensions should be chosen based on part functionality
- Tolerance stackup

Units
-----

- We will be using two unit system: International System of Units and U.S.
  Customary Units
- US, Liberia, Burma only countries that use the U.S. system.
- F = MLT^{-2}

M = FT^2 / L = (pound-force) (second)^2 = lbf * s^2 / ft = slug

- lbf: pound force
- kip : kilo pounds force

F = ML / T^2 = (kilogram) (meter) / (second)^2 = kg m / s^2 = N

W = mg

g = 9.81 m/s^2 = 32.2 ft/s^2

- Mars climate orbiter: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_Climate_Orbiter
- Cost about $600 million
- output lbf s instead of N s

Sig figs
--------

- sig figs are inferred by shown digits (except leading): 0.700"
- scientific notation: 706.0, 7.060x10^2, 0.7060x10^3, 7.060E2
- the smallest sig figs in a calc fix the number of sig figs you should report
- do all calcs at greatest accuracy possible and round at the end

Tolerance stack up exercise.

====

Free body diagrams

- used to isolate and identify internal and external loads on a design element
- includes coordinate system(s)
- lists known and unknown forces acting on the element(s)
- loads are required to determine stress in the member

Static equilibrium:

Sum F = 0
Sum M = 0

Exercise

Collect feedback

What we will go over next time: shear and moment diagrams for beams

Homework will be posted after class.

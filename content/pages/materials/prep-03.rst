:status: hidden

Preparation
===========

- Read sections 1-12 to 1-17, 3-1
- More info on free body diagrams can be found at
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_body_diagram for example (or your previous
  textbooks)
- Read sections 3-1
- More info on free body diagrams can be found at
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_body_diagram (or your previous strength of
  materials textbooks)

Concepts
========

After this lesson you should be able to:

- understand the difference in stochastic and deterministic failure criteria
- compute reliability's base on Gaussian data
- understand the relationship of factor of safety and reliability
- understand when to use the appropriate choice of dimensions and tolerances
- compute tolerance stack up
- use appropriate units and sig figs
- draw 2D and 3D free body diagrams of a mechanical structures


Concepts
========

After this lesson you should be able to:

- draw 2D and 3D free body diagrams of a mechanical structures
- find internal forces in loaded components

Upcoming Due Dates
==================

- We will check for 50 designs in your design notebook on Friday, Oct 2 in
  class
- Homework #1 will be due Monday, October 5


Concepts
========

These are the main concepts that you should have an understanding of after the
class (both from prepartion and in class).

- What mechanical engineering design is.
- Difference in stress and strength
- The relationship in uncertainty and safety factor

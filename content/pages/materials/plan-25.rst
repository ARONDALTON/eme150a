Review
------

- Fluctuating stresses
- Must check for yielding and fatigue failure
- Equivalent fully reversed stress is needed to determine finite life cycles
  for fluctuating stress.

Goals
-----

- Discuss pure torsion loading
- Compound loading

Quiz

====

Torsion (6-13)

S_su = 0.67 S_ut
Ssy = 0.577 Syt (distortion engery theory)
k_c = 0.59

Combined loadings

- generate two stress elements: mean and amplitude
- compute von mises stress
- don't use k_c for torsion, cause accounted for

Compound loading example

Lots going on next week (last week of classes):

Homework #8 due on Monday (two fluctuating stress and one fluctuating compound
loading)

Dynamic Loading Memo

- Where are the largest stresses seen from dynamic loads?
- How did you estimate the sigma max andd sigma min for the critical areas?
- What static and fatigue material properties did you obtain for your material
  choices?
- What type of fatigue stresses are seen?

Lightning talks on Friday

- Can use visuals: doc camera, board, projector
- 5 minutes to pitch your design (you will be cut off)
- Pick one team member that is the best speaker and have them practice in front
  of you beforehand.
- One method: ten slides at 30 seconds each
- Each member develops ~2 slides, writes 30 second script, one person practices
  it
- Look up pechakucha: concise presentations
- It takes more time than you expect to make it concise!
- The best talk will get a prize!
- Andy Wyly will come to help judge.

Feedback!!

:status: hidden


Review uncertainty
   Every number has an uncertainity associated with it and you must take this
   into account in design.

====

Free body diagrams

- used to isolate and identify internal and external loads on a design element
- includes coordinate system(s)
- lists known and unknown forces acting on the element(s)
- loads are required to determine stress in the member

Static equilibrium:

Sum F = 0
Sum M = 0

Exercise

Collect feedback

What we will go over next time: shear and moment diagrams for beams

Homework will be posted after class.

Free Body Diagrams

- system: any isolated part or portion of a machine or structure
- used to isolate and identify both internal and external loads on a design
  element
- defines:

  - coordinate systems
  - known and unknown forces

:math:`\sum F = \frac{dp}{dt}` and :math:`\sum M = \frac{dH}{dt}`

Static Equilibrium (no velocity)

F = 0 and M = 0

- The Martian Movie
- Questions?
- Are office hours at good times?
- Review: Free Body Diagrams

  - Draw system bound in whatever way is useful for problem
  - Equilibrium: F = 0, M = 0
  - Basic maximum stress for axial, bending, and torsion

- Pin joint demo

Today's goals:

 - Review of transversely loaded beams
 - Be able to draw shear and bending moment diagrams
 - Utilize singularity functions to efficiently draw diagrams


9:10
====

Shear and Bending diagrams

- Relation of q, V, M

9:20
====

- Shear and bending question

9:25
====

- Singularity functions for beams
- Example with singularity functions

9:40
====

- Singularity question

9:45
====

Wrap up

- Beam shear and moment values are piecewise functions
- Load, shear, and bending are related by derivatives
- Complex loadings can be more easily calculated with singularity functions

10:00
=====

- Description of the next step in the project: 5 more detailed designs are due
  next friday.

  - Answer more questions, more sketches, add calculations
  - Around 2 full notebook pages that are dense per design: ultimately will need
    3 pages of computer content for the final design
  - Focus on designs that will allow you to think about the loads, stresses,
    strength, motion
  - Describe lightning talks for next Friday

    - 2 minutes to describe to your group a design
    - 2 designs per member
    - practice before hand, make short script about main points (2 minutes
      doesn't give you time to flounder)
    - 2 minute review from groups

Questions?

10:10
=====

- Get in groups and work together on the homework or the provided examples
- Check on group sizes
- Have notebook out and ready for grading

10:45
=====

- Questions
- Collect feedback: feedback for the week will happen on Fridays
- positive, negative for the week and time spent outside of class

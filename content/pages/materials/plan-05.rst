Recap of uncertainty
--------------------

- Every number has an uncertainity associated with it and you must take this
  into account in design.
- Gaussian (Normal) Probability Density Functions can be used to make
  predictions if you know the mean and standard deviation.
- The standard normal curve is in Table A-10 and can be used to calculate
  probablities.

Learning Objectives
-------------------

- Be able to draw 3D free body diagrams of structural elements
- Be able to compute the 3D internal loads in structrual elements
- Be able to find the internal loads in a long slender beam
- Be able to use singularity functions to find shear and moment in beam

- Review of transversely loaded beams
- Be able to draw shear and bending moment diagrams
- Utilize singularity functions to efficiently draw diagrams

Dimensions, units, sig figs

Tolerances
----------

- Nominal sizes are note exact sizes
- Tolerance limits are specified as absolutes
- Tight tolerances = higher costs
- Dimensioning should include the minimum non-redudant info
- Dimensions should be chosen based on part functionality
- Tolerance stackup

Units
-----

- We will be using two unit system: International System of Units and U.S.
  Customary Units
- US, Liberia, Burma only countries that use the U.S. system.
- F = MLT^{-2}

M = FT^2 / L = (pound-force) (second)^2 = lbf * s^2 / ft = slug

- lbf: pound force
- kip : kilo pounds force

F = ML / T^2 = (kilogram) (meter) / (second)^2 = kg m / s^2 = N

W = mg

g = 9.81 m/s^2 = 32.2 ft/s^2

- Mars climate orbiter: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_Climate_Orbiter
- Cost about $600 million
- output lbf s instead of N s

Sig figs
--------

- sig figs are inferred by shown digits (except leading): 0.700"
- scientific notation: 706.0, 7.060x10^2, 0.7060x10^3, 7.060E2
- the smallest sig figs in a calc fix the number of sig figs you should report
- do all calcs at greatest accuracy possible and round at the end

Free body diagrams

- used to isolate and identify internal and external loads on a design element
- includes coordinate system(s)
- lists known and unknown forces acting on the element(s)
- loads are required to determine stress in the member

Static equilibrium:

Sum F = 0
Sum M = 0


Free Body Diagrams

- system: any isolated part or portion of a machine or structure
- used to isolate and identify both internal and external loads on a design
  element
- defines:

  - coordinate systems
  - known and unknown forces

:math:`\sum F = \frac{dp}{dt}` and :math:`\sum M = \frac{dH}{dt}`

Static Equilibrium (no velocity)

F = 0 and M = 0

====

Shear and Bending diagrams

- Relation of q, V, M

9:20
====

- Shear and bending question

9:25
====

- Singularity functions for beams
- Example with singularity functions

9:40
====

- Singularity question

9:45
====

Wrap up

- Beam shear and moment values are piecewise functions
- Load, shear, and bending are related by derivatives
- Complex loadings can be more easily calculated with singularity functions

Break

10:00
=====

- Description of the next step in the project: 5 more detailed designs are due
  next friday.

  - Answer more questions, more sketches, add calculations
  - Around 2 full notebook pages that are dense per design: ultimately will need
    3 pages of computer content for the final design
  - Focus on designs that will allow you to think about the loads, stresses,
    strength, motion
  - Describe lightning talks for next Friday

    - 2 minutes to describe to your group a design
    - 2 designs per member
    - practice before hand, make short script about main points (2 minutes
      doesn't give you time to flounder)
    - 2 minute review from groups

Questions?

10:10
=====

- Get in groups and work together on the homework or the provided examples
- Check on group sizes
- Have notebook out and ready for grading

10:45
=====

- Questions
- Collect feedback: feedback for the week will happen on Fridays
- positive, negative for the week and time spent outside of class

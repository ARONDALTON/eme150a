:title: Plan for Friday, October 2, 2015
:status: hidden

9:00
====

- The Martian Movie
- Questions?
- Are office hours at good times?
- Review: Free Body Diagrams

  - Draw system bound in whatever way is useful for problem
  - Equilibrium: F = 0, M = 0
  - Basic maximum stress for axial, bending, and torsion

- Pin joint demo

Today's goals:

 - Review of transversely loaded beams
 - Be able to draw shear and bending moment diagrams
 - Utilize singularity functions to efficiently draw diagrams

9:10

Shear and Bending diagrams

- Relation of q, V, M

9:20
====

- Shear and bending question

9:25
====

- Singularity functions for beams
- Example with singularity functions

9:40
====

- Singularity question

9:45
====

Wrap up

- Beam shear and moment values are piecewise functions
- Load, shear, and bending are related by derivatives
- Complex loadings can be more easily calculated with singularity functions

Break

10:00
=====

- Description of the next step in the project: 5 more detailed designs are due
  next friday.

  - Answer more questions, more sketches, add calculations
  - Around 2 full notebook pages that are dense per design: ultimately will need
    3 pages of computer content for the final design
  - Focus on designs that will allow you to think about the loads, stresses,
    strength, motion
  - Describe lightning talks for next Friday

    - 2 minutes to describe to your group a design
    - 2 designs per member
    - practice before hand, make short script about main points (2 minutes
      doesn't give you time to flounder)
    - 2 minute review from groups

Questions?

10:10
=====

- Get in groups and work together on the homework or the provided examples
- Check on group sizes
- Have notebook out and ready for grading

10:45
=====

- Questions
- Collect feedback: feedback for the week will happen on Fridays
- positive, negative for the week and time spent outside of class

Class Activities
================

=========== ====================================================================
9:00-9:15   Introduction, meet your neighbors
9:15-9:25   Questions about syllabus, about class, etc.
9:25-9:35   What is mechanical engineering design? Team up with your three
            nearest neighbors and come up with a definition of mechanical
            design in your own words.
9:35-9:45   Discuss answers, write key words on the board
9:45-9:50   Wrap up
=========== ====================================================================

Intro 9:00
==========

- Destiny introduces herself

  - Tell them about yourself (e.g. name, from, research, hobbies, etc)
  - Show them what you did in EME 150A and EME 150B
  - Mabuchi on Mah Booty
  - Tell them briefly about the project for this class: they will design a
    bicycle rack for a Unitrans bus.

- Introduction activity

  - Group into groups of ~4
  - Tell your group your name
  - What machines you hope to design in the future
  - Ask a couple of students to volunteer and share with whole class what they
    learned.

Class Questions 9:15
====================

- Any syllabus questions? (open up the website on the screen)

  - I'll ask them to review the syllabus and class website before arriving. So
    just ask for questions here.

- Show them Canvas (it may be new to many)
- Show them Piazza and explain how it works and that this is the primary place
  to ask questions pertaining to class. Mention that we will award points to
  top participants.
- Let them know that we will meet in Bainer 2071 on Fridays.
- Should bring design notebook on Friday for activity.

What is Mechanical Design? 9:25
===============================

- Back in same groups of ~4
- Goal: definition of mechanical engineering design in 1-2 sentences.
- Think about what you read in Chapter 1 and your previous experience.
- Destiny can visit groups and help conversation along.
- 10 minutes, ends at 9:35

Answers 9:35
============

Have students say their definitions. While they answer write down important
words on the board. After you get about 10 to 15 key words, state a defintion
using the collected words. Or have them all rewrite their definition with all
the words. You can share your definition too. My is below:

   The process of creating a solution to a problem or need utilizing mechanical
   systems and principles under constraints such as limited resources, limited
   knowledge, or codes and standards. The process involves creativity,
   ideation, ingenuity, and analysis that may need to guarantee safety,
   maintainability, sustainability, ethical standards, etc.

Typical mechanical design process
---------------------------------

Write the mechanical design process on the board.

Emphasize that this is iterative!

1. Identify the needs
2. Rewrite needs as engineering specifications
3. Generate concepts
4. Evaluate concepts to see if they meet the needs and specs
5. Select best concepts
6. Test prototypes best concepts to see if they actually meet the needs and
   specs
7. Select best concept

TODO : Update the above once I look at the EME 185 book again.

Wrapup 9:45
===========

Remind them to:

  - come to Bainer 2071 on Friday at 9 AM
  - bring a design notebook
  - fill out CATME by midnight tonight

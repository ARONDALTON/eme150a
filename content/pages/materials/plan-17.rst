- Midterm is only half graded, will return on Friday.
- Project 1 reports are graded. Shared the rubric I used and some comments.
  Overall very good. I think the peer reviews helped a lot. I learned a lot of
  fun things too. There was a light trend of erroneous analyses or not very
  thorough analysis. It was better to put things you know are correct than a
  lot that may not be correct.
- Project 2 reports should be enhanced versions of these. Combine all that you
  did well with on the project 1 reports to improve and make your project 2
  report shine.

Review
------

- Last talked about stiffness of various types of loaded elements.

Goals
-----

- Utilize strain energy and Castigliano's theorem to find deflections quickly.

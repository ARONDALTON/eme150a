:title: Project Two: Unitrans Bicycle Rack Design
:status: hidden

Introduction
============

Your team will be tasked with developing a design to meet a hypothetical need
of `Unitrans <http://unitrans.ucdavis.edu>`_, the public transportation
authority in Davis, CA. Davis is known as the "Bicycle Capital of the United
States" and Unitrans finally wants to figure out how to carry bicycles on their
buses like many other transit authorities in the country [1]_. Your team's job
will be to develop a detailed mechanical design for a dual bicycle rack that is
mounted to the front of a typical Unitrans bus. The design will have to meet a
number of constraints and have a variety of features, all while being safe,
easy to operate, easy to maintain, and be cost effective.

.. [1] In actuality, most cities that have high bicycle and high transit usage
   discourage bringing bicycles on public transit because there simply isn't
   room. Davis is likely in this camp.

Goals
=====

- Log your design activities in your design notebook or in electronic documents
  and keep you materials well organized.
- You must performed detailed static and dynamic failure analyses for your
  design to prove that your design meets all requirements and is safe for
  consumer use. You will need to report an overall factor of safety that should
  be appropriate for this type of product.
- You should be able to describe your design using verbal, written, and
  graphical communication means.
- You will need to estimate the cost of manufacture and report an estimated
  "Manufacturers Suggest Retail Price (MSRP)" price for the design.
- Include any pertinent information that you find during your research.

Design Contraints and Feature Requirements
==========================================

- The bicycle rack must be able to carry at least two normal bicycles (wheel
  size 20" to 29", road and mountain width tire tread). The maximum weight of a
  single bike shall be no more than 55 lbs. It will not accommodate
  non-standard things like unicycles, tandems, recumbents, etc.
- The rack should be able to hold a static load of 250 lbs, e.g. a person
  should be able to stand on it while washing the window.
- The rack must be attached to the front bumper area of the chassis.
- The rack should have a "stowed" configuration and a "loaded" configuration,
  i.e. if bicycles are not being carried, the rack should be take up less space
  and be fully secured from motion. The "stowing" should be able to be done
  with one hand.
- The bicycles must be guaranteed not to fall off during transit.
- It must be usable by a variety of people and allow for the easiest possible
  bicycle attachment to the rack.
- The bicycles can not be damaged in any way by the rack.
- The footprint of the rack should be as small as possible while meeting other
  design needs.
- The rack must be manufactured using traditional manufacturing techniques and
  made of standard steel or aluminum structural elements.
- The rack must be corrosion resistant and designed for an all-weather
  environment.
- Each bicycles must be able to be loaded independently.
- It should never force the user to be on the traffic side of the bus to
  load/unload the bicycle.
- The operation should be intuitively obvious or clear simple instructions
  provided on or near the rack.
- The rack itself should weight no more than 75 lbs.
- The rack should not protrude past the sides of the bus.

Obtaining Information
=====================

Matt and Jason will act as the project supervisors who are in direct contact
with the stakeholder (Unitrans). To obtain information from the stakeholder or
to find out information that isn't discoverable in your research you will ask
your questions through Piazza. Your questions need to be professional, clearly
communicated, and pointed. They should be written in format, tone, language
that you'd expect to see in professional communication. With good questions we
will provide you with the needed information to clarify the details. But, keep
in mind that there may not always be an answer and it is up to your team to
make the best decisions with the available information.

Activities
==========

Monday, November 2nd
--------------------

We will use the class period to introduce the project and begin the ideation
process. After the introduction, you will join your team members to start
developing your design ideas. We will follow this process:

Question Generation (5 minutes)
   Individually, on sticky notes, write down as many questions as you can think
   of that will need to be answered to complete your design. Stick these notes
   onto the wall by your team so every one can see them.
Question review (5 minutes)
   Read your teammates questions quickly to get an idea of what everyone is
   thinking about.
Question Grouping (5 minutes)
   Pick 3-5 broad topic areas and group the questions into these topics.
   Eliminate duplicates by combining them into one question.
Design Ideation Sketching (5 minutes)
   At this point you will each go to the sheets of white paper on the walls and
   sketch a design independently.
Design Sketching Modifications (5 minutes)
   Next rotate positions so that you are in front of a teammates design. Below
   the teammates design, add, subtract, or modify the their design to create a
   new design.
Design Review and Discussion (10 minutes)
    Now discuss the merits of each design idea. Add new questions and refine
    the previous ones that will need to be determined to make decisions each
    design's merits.

Tuesday, November 3rd
---------------------

At least one team member will visit the Unitrans maintenance facility on campus
to meet with Andrew Wyly, the Maintenance Manager. You will have the
opportunity to ask many of the questions developed during the ideation session
and inspect the bus for technical details. Be sure to bring a camera and a
measuring device. This may be your only chance to inspect the actual bus in
detail.

Friday, November 20
-------------------

If time permits we will have a TBA activity for project 2 during discussion.

Friday, December 4th
--------------------

During the discussion period each team will have a five minute lightning talk
to pitch their design to the rest of the class. Your goal is to show why your
design meets all of the requirements and why it would be the best choice. You
can use any kind of communication media that you want, e.g. the board,
projector, handouts, etc. Your goal is communicate your technical information
as clearly and succinctly as possible. Think carefully about the mediums you
use to do this.


Reports
=======

You will create four memos that culminate in a full final report. The
reports will all be turned in as PDFs to Smartsite on the respective due date.
Each report should stand on its own but you will be able to use the content
from the memos in the final report.

- Each report must be submitted as a single PDF document.
- Your group is free to use any software you prefer to prepare the documents.
- The reports should be treated as a professional documents and should be self
  contained.

Memos
-----

The memos are at most one page. The formatting is informal, but professional.
Use these to report the required progress and to act as drafts for your final
report sections. The more you put into these this less work you'll need when
preparing the final report.

Plan and Ideation (Friday, November 6)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This report should show your team's plan of execution with action items,
milestones with dates, and projected team task assignments. Furthermore, you
should report on the current state of the design, what questions you've found
answers for and the plans for utilizing that information, and the top design
concepts you will pursue.

Initial Design (Friday, November 13)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This report should detail the primary concept that your team has selected to
pursue. You should at least have back-of-the-envelope calculations, drawings,
and other items in place that gives confidence that your design will likely
meet the requirements and hold up to more scrutinous analyses.

Static Failure (Friday, November 20)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The static failure memo is due today. You will need to show that your
your design will have a sufficient safety factor for static loads.

Dynamic Failure (Wednesday December 2)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The dynamic failure memo is due today. You will need to show that your
your design will have a sufficient safety factor for dynamic loads.

Final Report
------------

The final report in PDF format will be due via Smartsite by midnight Sunday,
December 6th. See below for report format details.

Title Page
~~~~~~~~~~

The title page should include the title, authors, team name, date, course
number, and an abstract (~150 words).

Table of Contents
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The second page(s) of your report should include a table of contents, list of
figures, and list of tables showing a title and page number for all items.

Content Sections
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The main content of the report should not exceed 6 pages. The content should
cover, but not be limited to, these topics:

Introduction
   Provide the reader with the premise and motivation along with describing
   what the reader should expect to learn by reading the report.
Design Description
   This should provide a description of the design need, concept, operation,
   weaknesses/strengths, etc.
Analysis
   This section should explain the results of the analyses you used to ensure
   your design meets the constraints and requirements.
Manufacturing
   This section should provide the estimates and explanations of
   manufacturability including costs.
Conclusion
   The conclusion should wrap up you paper and can mention lessons learned and
   ideas for the future.

References
~~~~~~~~~~

All text and materials in the paper that were not created by your team must be
cited here. Be sure to up-hold copyright laws on any included material.

Appendices
~~~~~~~~~~

The appendices can contain details that don't belong in the main text. Examples
are layout drawings, renderings, detailed calculations, etc. Anything that
takes attention away from the main points in the paper should go in the
appendices.

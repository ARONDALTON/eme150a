:title: Project Two: Unitrans Bicycle Rack Design
:status: hidden

Introduction
============

Your team will be tasked with developing a design to meet a hypothetical need
of `Unitrans <http://unitrans.ucdavis.edu>`_, the public transportation system
in Davis, CA. Davis is known as the "Bicycle Capital of the United States" and
Unitrans finally wants to figure out how to carry bicycles on their buses. Your
team's job will be to develop a detailed mechanical design for a dual bicycle
rack that is mounted to the front of a typical Unitrans bus. The design will
have to meet a number of constraints and have a variety of features, all while
being safe, easy to operate, easy to maintain, and be cost effective.

Design Contraints and Feature Requirements
==========================================

- The bicycle rack must be able to carry at least two normal bicycles (wheel
  size 20" to 29", road and mountain width tire tread). The maximum weight of a
  single bike shall be no more than 55 lbs. It will not accommodate
  non-standard things like unicycles, tandems, recumbents, etc.
- The rack must be attached to the front bumper area of the chassis.
- The rack should have a "stowed" configuration and a "loaded" configuration,
  i.e. if bicycles are not being carried, the rack should be take up less space
  and be fully secured from motion. The "stowing" should be able to be done
  with one hand.
- The bicycles must be guaranteed not to fall off during transit.
- It must be usable by a variety of people and allow for the easiest possible
  bicycle attachment to the rack.
- The bicycles can not be damaged in any way by the rack.
- The footprint of the rack should be as small as possible while meeting other
  design needs.
- The rack must be manufactured using traditional manufacturing techniques and
  made of standard steel or aluminum structural elements.
- The rack must be corrosion resistant and designed for an all-weather
  environment.
- Each bicycles must be able to be loaded independently.
- It should never force the user to be on the traffic side of the bus to
  load/unload the bicycle.
- The operation should be intuitively obvious or clear simple instructions
  provided on or near the rack.
- The rack itself should weight no more than 75 lbs.
- The rack should not protrude past the sides of the bus.

Goals
=====

- Log your design activities in your design notebook or in electronic documents
  and keep you materials well organized.
- You must performed detailed static and dynamic failure analyses for your
  design to prove that your design meets all requirements and is safe for
  consumer use. You will need to report an overall factor of safety that should
  be appropriate for this type of product.
- You should be able to describe your design using verbal, written, and
  graphical communication means.
- You will need to estimate the cost of manufacture and report an estimated
  "Manufacturers Suggest Retail Price (MSRP)" price for the design.
- Include any pertinent information that you find during your research.

Important Dates
===============

Monday, November 2nd
--------------------

We will use the class period to introduce the project and begin the ideation
process. After the introduction, you will join your team members to start
developing your design ideas. We will follow this process:

Question Generation (5 minutes)
   Individually, on sticky notes, write down as many questions as you can think
   of that will need to be answered to complete your design. Stick these notes
   onto the wall by your team so every one can see them.
Question review (5 minutes)
   Read your teammates questions quickly to get an idea of what everyone is
   thinking about.
Question Grouping (5 minutes)
   Pick 3-5 broad topic areas and group the questions into these topics.
   Eliminate duplicates by combining them into one question.
Design Ideation Sketching (5 minutes)
   At this point you will each go to the sheets of white paper on the walls and
   sketch a design independently.
Design Sketching Modifications (5 minutes)
   Next rotate positions so that you are in front of a teammates design. Below
   the teammates design, add, subtract, or modify the their design to create a
   new design.
Design Review and Discussion (10 minutes)
    Now discuss the merits of each design idea. Add new questions and refine
    the previous ones that will need to be determined to make decisions each
    design's merits.

Tuesday, November 3rd
---------------------

At least one team member will visit the Unitrans maintenance facility on campus
to meet with Andrew Wyly, the Maintenance Manager. You will have the
opportunity to ask many of the questions developed during the ideation session
and inspect the bus for technical details. Be sure to bring a camera and a
measuring device. This may be your only chance to inspect the actual bus in
detail.

Friday, November 6
------------------

Initial design ideas are due.

Friday, November 13
-------------------


Friday, November 20
-------------------

Static failure due.

Monday, November 30
-------------------

Dynamic failure due.

Friday, December 4th
--------------------

During the discussion period each team will have a five minute lightning talk
to pitch their design to the rest of the class. Your goal is to show why your
design meets all of the requirements and why it would be the best choice. You
can use any kind of communication media that you want, e.g. the board,
projector, handouts, etc. Your goal is communicate your technical information
as clearly and succinctly as possible. Think carefully about the mediums you
use to do this.

Sunday, December 6
------------------

The final report in PDF format will be due via Smartsite by midnight Sunday,
December 6th. See below for report format details.

Report Requirements
===================

Grading
=======

The grade for the final project will be broken up as such:

======================  ====
Initial design          10%
Static failure review   10%
Dynamic failure review  10%
Lightning talk          10%
Final Report            60%
======================  ====

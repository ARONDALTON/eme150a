Final Information
=================

- Closed book, closed notes, no written materials allowed, no devices except a
  non-programmable calculator and/or drawing implements.
- I'll provide the paper.
- Comprehensive but focused more on content after the midterm. You will
  definitely need to know the main stress/strain concepts from the first
  portion to complete the problems from the second portion.
- Same style as the midterm:

  - True/False
  - Multiple Choice
  - Short Answer
  - Long Answer

- I will provide a sheet with the essential equations, tables, and graphs.
- Review the instructor's class notes, your notes, the book sections, and the
  homeworks.

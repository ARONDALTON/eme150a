Final Information
=================

- Closed book, no written materials allowed, no devices except a
  non-programmable calculator and/or drawing implements.
- I'll provide the paper.
- Same style as the midterm:

  - True/False
  - Multiple Choice
  - Short Answer
  - Long Answer

- Comprehensive but focused more on everything after the midterm. You will need
  to know the main stress/strain concepts from the first portion to complete
  the problems from the second portion.
- I will provide a sheet with the essential equations, tables, and graphs.
- Review the instructor's class notes, your noes, the book sections, and the
  homeworks.

Book Sections to Review

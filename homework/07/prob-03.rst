Problem 3
=========

Determine the required diameter for a round steel element that is axially
loaded from -2500 to 2500 lb in fully reversed cycles. Assume it is ground,
:math:`S_{ut} = 150 \mathrm{ksi}`, and is loaded at :math:`T = 70^\circ
\mathrm{F}`. Determine the diameter for infinite life and :math:`10^3` cycles.

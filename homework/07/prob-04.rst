Problem 4
=========

A simple hot rolled 1020 steel cantilever beam of length 0.6 m is loaded
transversely at the end with a fully reversing load of :math:`\pm 5
\mathrm{kN}`. The beam has a rectangular cross section with a width of
:math:`40 \mathrm{mm}`. What is the required height of the beam's cross section
to guarantee safe operation up to :math:`N = 10^4 \mathrm{cycles}` with a
design factor of 2? Neglect any stress concentrations.

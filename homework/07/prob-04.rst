Problem 4
=========

Given a 2024-T3 aluminum specimen forged to :math:`2.0 \mathrm{in}` round,
determine the fatigue strength for :math:`3 \times 10^7` cycles of loading for
fully reversed torsion. Note that for non-ferrous metals, the unmodified
fatigue strength is taken at :math:`N = 5 \times 10^8` cycles (see Table A-24).

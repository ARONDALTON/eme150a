**Part 2**
   It has been determined that the design factor for this part is to be 3 with
   respect to yielding. If the material is 1018 steel, will a cross section
   width of :math:`w=1cm` of the square bar be able to meet this design factor
   if only the maximum normal stress is considered with :math:`P=120N`,
   :math:`a=6cm`, and :math:`b=5cm`? Compute the actual factor of safety to
   show this.

**Part 3**
   Explain in words the difference between "design factor" and "factor of
   safety".

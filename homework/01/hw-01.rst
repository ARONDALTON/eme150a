================================

:date: Monday, September 28, 2015

**DUE: Monday, October 05, 2015 before class in Box D in the MAE department.**


Problem 1
=========

Your manufacturing company has been contracted to manufacture 10,000 custom
cotter pins that secure the PTO to external attachments for a new tractor
model. The delivered outer diameter of the pins must be :math:`0.625\pm0.01"`.
Your quality control team has run some test batches of the pins and have found
that the manufacturing process produces a mean diameter of 0.621" with a
standard deviation of 0.004". How many more pins will you have to make to
ensure you deliver 10,000 pins that meet the criteria?

Problem 2
=========

**Part 1**
   Determine the internal loads and the maximum normal stress at section
   **C-C** (symbolic form).

**Part 2**
   It has been determined that the design factor for this part is to be 3 with
   respect to yielding. If the material is 1018 steel, will a cross section
   width of :math:`w=1cm` of the square bar be able to meet this design factor
   if only the maximum normal stress is considered with :math:`P=60N`,
   :math:`a=6cm`, and :math:`b=5cm`? Compute the actual factor of saftey to
   show this.

Problem 3
=========

Draw the shear and moment diagrams for the beam shown in the figure.

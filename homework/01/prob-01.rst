Problem 1
=========

Your manufacturing company has been contracted to manufacture 10,000 custom
cotter pins that secure the PTO to external attachments for a new tractor
model. The delivered outer diameter of the pins must be :math:`0.625\pm0.01"`.
Your quality control team has run some test batches of the pins and have found
that the manufacturing process produces a mean diameter of 0.621" with a
standard deviation of 0.004". How many more pins will you have to make to
ensure you deliver 10,000 pins that meet the criteria?

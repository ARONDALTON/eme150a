Problem 2
=========

A pressure vessel is made of an aluminum alloy tubing with suitable end
closures. This cylinder has a 3.5" in OD and a 0.1875" wall thickness. The
material has a tensile yield strength of 46 kpsi and a compressive yield
strength of 60 kpsi. Using the Coulomb-Mohr Theory, determine the factor of
safety if the pressure-release valve is set at 2500 psi.

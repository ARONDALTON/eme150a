Problem 1
=========

The solid rod shown in the figure is subject to the two loads at point B. The
rod has a radius of 0.75 in. Determine the state of stress at point A, sketch
the stress cube, and write out the stress tensor with respect to the provide
coordinate system.

Problem 3
=========

The figure below shows the state of plane stress at a point. Draw the state of

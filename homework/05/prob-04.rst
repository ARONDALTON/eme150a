Problem 4
=========

Determine an expression for what the outside diameter of a slender tube must be
for buckling to occur if the inside diameter is d, the outside diameter is D,
and the ratio of the two is K=d/D. The expression should be in terms of K, the
critical load, column length, modulus of elasticity, and the end condition
constant.

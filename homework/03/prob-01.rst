Problem 1
=========

What is the maximum force :math:`F` that can be applied to this system to
ensure that the stress in member :math:`CD` never exceeds 20 kpsi and the point
:math:`A` moves no more than 0.05"? Assume that the curved bar, :math:`ABC`, is
much more rigid than :math:`CD`, i.e. assume it doesn't deform. The modulus of
elasticity of the bar :math:`CD` is :math:`6\times10^6
\frac{\mathrm{lb}}{\mathrm{in}^2}` and the cross sectional area is
:math:`0.25\mathrm{in}^2`.

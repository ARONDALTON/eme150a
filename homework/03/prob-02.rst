Problem 2
=========

Three strain gauges are arranged in the orientation shown below on a free
surface of a stressed member. The measured strains from the strain gauges are:

- :math:`\epsilon_A = 50\times10^{-6}`
- :math:`\epsilon_B = 120\times10^{-6}`
- :math:`\epsilon_C = 264\times10^{-6}`

a. Derive the symbolic expressions for :math:`\epsilon_x, \epsilon_y,
   \epsilon_z` for this configuration. Use only rational numbers, i.e. no
   decimal numbers and compute the state of strain.
b. Find the principal strains and directions.
c. If :math:`E=106\mathrm{GPa}` and :math:`G=40\mathrm{GPa}`, what are the
   principal stresses and directions? Keep in mind that the normal stress on
   the surface is 0 because it is a free surface.
d. What is the maximum principal shear stress?

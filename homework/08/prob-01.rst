Problem 1
=========

A steel tensile link with a circular cross section with no stress
concentrations is subjected to a fluctuating load (1000 to 5000 lbs). Use
:math:`S_{ut}=150\mathrm{kpsi}`, :math:`S_y=120\mathrm{kpsi}`. Assume a highly
polished specimen and design factor of 2. Find the diameter for infinite life
and for :math:`10^3` cycles.

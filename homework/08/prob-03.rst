Problem 3
=========

The AISI hot rolled 1020 steel element shown is welded to the fixed plate with
a 0.125" fillet weld. This fillet introduces stress concentration factors of
:math:`K_{t}=1.8` and :math:`K_{ts}=1.6`. The dimensions are
:math:`d=0.875\mathrm{in}`, :math:`l_1=4\mathrm{in}`, :math:`l_2=3\mathrm{in}`.
The load F cycles from 50 lbs to 100 lbs. Using the Goodman criteria for
fluctuating stress, find the factor of safety at point A with respect to
infinite life or the number of cycles to failure for finite life.

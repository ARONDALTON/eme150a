Problem 3
=========

The element shown is welded to the fixed plate with a fillet weld. This fillet
introduces stress concentration factors of :math:`K_{t}=1.8` and
:math:`K_{ts}=1.6`. The dimensions are :math:`d=0.875\mathrm{in}`,
:math:`l_1=2\mathrm{ft}`, :math:`l_2=1\mathrm{in}`. The load F cycles from 300
lbs to 750 lbs. Using the Goodman criteria for fluctuating stress, find the
factor of safety at point A with respect to infinite life or the number of
cycles to failure for finite life.

Problem 3
=========

For the beam and loading shown, find both the slope and deflection at points C
and D using two different methods. Additionally, describe the slope between
points C and D. Use :math:`l = 1.2 \textrm{m}`, :math:`E = 180 \textrm{GPa}`,
:math:`I = 0.23 \textrm{m}^4`, :math:`w = 60 \frac{\textrm{kN}}{\textrm{m}}`.

Problem 4
=========

Beverage cans are made from tin plated steel in some parts of the world instead
of an aluminum alloy. Design a can that is a typical can size using 1018
hot-rolled steel (Table A-20) such that it meets a specified design factor of 3
against yielding if the maximum pressure that can be developed in the can by
the undissolved CO2 is 350 KPa. How much thicker or thinner must the can walls
be compared to a typical aluminum alloy can?

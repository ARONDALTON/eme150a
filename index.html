<p>This course introduces the student to mechanical design theory and methodology
that build on the fundamentals learned in statics, dynamics, strength of
materials, computer aided drafting, and manufacturing. The course will prepare
the student to both individually and collaboratively design mechanical systems
that will be safe from failure and ensure that other design constraints are
met.</p>
<div class="section" id="objectives">
<h3>Objectives</h3>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Students will demonstrate the use of analytical skills and intuitive
judgment for mechanical design and the evaluation of structural integrity.</li>
<li>Students will identify and use appropriate resources in engineering design
and failure analysis.</li>
<li>Students will solve open-ended design problems that require conceptual and
analytical problem solving and create documentation of design solutions.</li>
<li>Students will demonstrate effective engineering writing.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Time and Location</h2>
<p>The lecture/discussion meets on Mondays and Wednesdays from 9:00-9:50 AM in
Hutchison Hall 102 and Fridays 9:00-10:50 AM in Bainer 2071 (MAE Design
Studio).</p>
<p><strong>If you have any conflicts with the schedule, especially for the midterm or
exam, you must tell me in the first week of class (emergencies will be the only
exception).</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="office-hours">
<h2>Office Hours</h2>
<p>Jason will hold office hours on Thursdays 10-11AM and Fridays from 2-3PM in
Bainer 2095. If you have a time conflict and need to meet outside of these
times, please find an available time on Jason's <a class="reference external" href="http://www.moorepants.info/work-calendar.html">schedule</a> and email him with
the request.</p>
<p>Destiny will hold office hours on Wednesdays from 1-2PM and Fridays from 12-1PM
in the MAE Design Studio 2071 Bainer Hall.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="academic-integrity">
<h2>Academic Integrity</h2>
<p>Academic dishonesty will not be tolerated. Please visit the <a class="reference external" href="http://sja.ucdavis.edu/academic-integrity.html">Academic Integrity
web page</a> from UC Davis
Office of Student Judicial Affairs to review the campus' policy on academic
responsibility and integrity and read the UC Davis <a class="reference external" href="http://sja.ucdavis.edu/cac.html">code of academic conduct</a>.</p>
<p>The midterm and final exam will be closed note, closed book and done on an
individual basis.</p>
<p>Feel free to discuss homework assignments and work on them together, but each
student must turn in a <em>unique</em> solution. Keep in mind that actually doing all
of the homework yourself is critical for learning and passing the course.</p>
<p>The first project will be an individual project but have elements of
collaboration built in. The second project will be a group effort but also
include individual evaluation based on peer evaluations.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="textbook">
<h2>Textbook</h2>
<p><em>Shigley's Mechanical Engineering Design</em>, Budynas and Nisbett, 10th Edition,
McGraw Hill Education. ISBN 978-0-07-339820-4 [<a class="reference external" href="http://highered.mheducation.com/sites/0073398209/information_center_view0/index.html">Book Information</a>]</p>
<p>Reading will be assigned from the textbook. I will do my best to provide the
homework in a way that doesn't require you purchase the book to read any
problems but this is not guaranteed. Older editions will be more than
sufficient for reading and studying. Keep in mind that this particular textbook
is one of the better references to have for your career if you work in
mechanical design.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="assignments-grades">
<h2>Assignments &amp; Grades</h2>
<p>Grades will be available in the <a class="reference external" href="http://canvas.ucdavis.edu">canvas.ucdavis.edu</a> grade book periodically
throughout the course along with class statistics. Check the website on a
regular basis to gauge your performance. Keep in mind that <strong>15% is deducted
per business day late</strong> on all assignments.</p>
